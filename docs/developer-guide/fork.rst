Forking PyKOALA
===============

Working on a fork enables you to develop your own copy of PyKOALA, contributing your code back to the main repository through a "pull request."

How to fork
-----------
First, click “Fork this repository” on the main PyKOALA repository in github. You then have your own copy of PyKOALA in github.com/USERNAME/koala

How to work on your fork
------------------------
Clone a copy of your fork onto a local machine:
::

    git clone git@github.com:USERNAME/koala

This gets a copy of the entire repository. Here replace USERNAME with your GitHub username.

Additional documentation is avaialable [here](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo).

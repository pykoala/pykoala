Welcome to PyKoala's documentation!
=================================


PyKOALA is a Python package to reduce KOALA+AAOmega integral field spectroscopy (IFS) data creating a data cube. It produces full calibrated (wavelength, flux and astrometry) data cubes ready for science.

`KOALA`_, the Kilofibre Optical AAT Lenslet Array, is a wide-field, high efficiency, integral field unit used by the 
AAOmega spectrograph on the 3.9m AAT `Anglo-Australian Telescope`_ at Siding Spring Observatory. **PyKOALA** is the forthcoming data reduction pipeline for 
creating science-ready 3D data cubes using Raw Stacked Spectra (RSS) images created with `2dfdr`_.
